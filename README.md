# Excel-Capstone-Project


During my training with Cybersafe foundation (DigiGirls) I had to complete a Capstone project for every course before being awarded a certificate.
The data set given to me contained relevant sales data for different items and channels across several countries in all regions of the world.

The data set was first cleaned by removing duplicates and by deleting rows with empty cells.
I went on to prepare the data for further and easy analysis by creating a table.
The data set was finally ready for analysis and i proceeded to answer the questions given by creating pivot tables and different types of charts using Excel.
